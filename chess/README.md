# Chess Board - HTML & CSS

This project represents a chessboard built using HTML5 and CSS. The chessboard is displayed in a table format where each square is either light or dark, simulating a traditional chessboard. The chess pieces are represented by Unicode symbols.

## Features

- **Table Layout**: The chessboard is constructed using the `<table>` element, with rows and columns representing the 8x8 grid of a chessboard.
- **Customizable Styling**: The squares alternate between light and dark colors using CSS classes.
- **Unicode Chess Pieces**: Each chess piece is represented by its corresponding Unicode character for a clean and scalable appearance.
- **Responsive Design**: The chessboard adjusts to different screen sizes with the use of the `viewport` meta tag.
